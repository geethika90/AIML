    "ANN is ideal for solving problems regarding data. Image data, text data, and tabular data can be easily processed by forward facing algorithms. CNN requires many more data inputs to achieve its novel high accuracy rate. In many cases, to get the same accuracy as ANN for data processing, you have to use multiple methods of data augmentation to widen the reaches of your data. ANN has the ability to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables.\n",

    "Deep Learning models are usually applied to problems that deal with data that do not have a simple row-column structure, like image classification or language translation, as they are great at operating on unstructured and complex-structure data these tasks handle — images, text, and sound. There are problems with handling data of these types and sizes with classical Machine Learning algorithms, and creating and applying some deep neural networks to these problems have caused tremendous developments in the fields of image recognition, speech recognition, text classification, and language translation in the last few years."
